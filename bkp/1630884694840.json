So, the same ppl will convince me my problem is my mom? She is just enjoying how I can be her bird that she can look at at any time, she just thinks I\u0027m protected.\n\nI don\u0027t want my mom in the bughouse; my uncle and my sister can\u0027t put me against my mom, if not herself. As as my uncle tried to convince me \"youre throwing my nphw against me\", it\u0027s wrong: it\u0027s him throwing me against himself.\nMy mom is wrong in a lot of things; it doesn\u0027t mean people should be cancelled; because captivity and the \"manicomios\" are an gourmetized way of, in the very \"democracy\" we think to live on, canceling people.\nAll the world need is not to fight one another (in-family fights, \"race\" vs. \"race\", trans (binaries) vs. trans (non-binaries), anything vs. anything on Twitter) for \"surviving\", but to be free from the ones who are rising their agenda while promoting this.\nTwitter and Facebook banning Trump (only an figure) wouldn\u0027t solve this. The far-right and the alt-left (far-right infiltrated in the left) are rising globally and a lot of people are ignoring; should I be against these people? No. It\u0027s not their fault; I were one of them. They need to wake up.\n\nThe world is getting destroyed by nihilists, narcissists who took the power illegitimate; are you an pseudonihilist to accept because life is getting shorter (isn\u0027t simply short as they told to calm you, but getting shorter) and you think it\u0027s normal? 9/5/21 21:00 ","creation":1630884694840,"lastModification":1630886436860,"locked":false,"reminderFired":false,"title":"","trashed":false}
